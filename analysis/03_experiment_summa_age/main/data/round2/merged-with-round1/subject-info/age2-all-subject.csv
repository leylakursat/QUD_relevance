10,2.30,Yes,Male,"The directions were not specific, so I could have answered a little differently.  If it dropped all the gumballs and the statement was ""you got 2 of the gumballs"", then the answer is technically Yes.  But I was consistent with a No for that type of question because the statement was not accurate enough - although it was technically correct.  I stayed with this concept all the way through.  It could have been wrong to do so.  But I wanted to show consistency.  I hope my explanation is helpful.",2,62,English,2,"no, all went well."

32,whatever,Confused,Male,"See what I wrote for the ""problems"" question above.",2,66,English,3,"Sometimes when the screen changed the ""press space"" command at the top got cut off and I had to scroll to see it.  And of course I had trouble deciding things like if the word ""some"" INCLUDED ""all"", or if I got 7 gumballs then I got any number less than 7, etc., but I'm guessing that was the point of the study.  I sure hope that poor guy didn't lose his job because of me"

43,yes,Yes,Female,This was a fun experiment.  Thank you.,2,60,English,3,"If I got ALL of the gumballs, and the machine said I got SOME of the gumballs I wasn't sure how to answer."
44,2.30,Yes,Female,Very interesting! I found myself concentrating so hard!,2,58,English,4,No
45,yes,Yes,Female,above,2,67,English,3,I wasn't sure if all could also mean some or if there were 8 gumballs you could say you got at least 2 of them.

53,3.00,Yes,Female,"I wasnt sure if when I got all of the gumballs that was equivalent to ""some"" of the gumballs.  I may have answered both ways but ultimately decided that all was not the same as some.",2,55,United States,3,No problems!
54,2.00,Yes,Female,"when it said ""some"" and I got ""all"" I wasn't exactly sure whether to say I agree or not",2,59,English,1,no
55,2.30,Yes,Female,,2,53,English,3,"Yes, photos sometimes loaded after the voice over."
56,0.50,Confused,Female,Easy & fun but the instructions were a confusing.  ,2,53,English,3,"When the question was asked, ""You got 2 of the gumballs"", I didn't understand if it was asking how many were left the machine (went down) or how many he had left in the machine."
57,3.00,Yes,Female,,1,59,English,3,no
58,2.30,Yes,Female,"I know I messed up once, my finger pressed before my brain.  It was definitely more interesting than a lot of the hits i worked on.  thanks!",2,55,english,1,no
59,$2.30,Yes,Female,That was interesting. I had some anxiety on the poor employees behalf in spite of myself.,2,50,English,3,no not that I noticed
60,yes,Yes,Female,"If this were a real thing, I think it would be better for the clerk to know how many gumballs remained rather than how many were dispensed. ",1,61,English,2,no

64,2.30,Yes,Female,I loved the visual and interaction. Thank you ,2,45,English,3,"I beleive there was a lag in the program. The voice would state a number and I would answer and then the next picture was the same as the number asked previously. Also, some of  the numbers being spoken were difficult to understand. (7 &2)  With the amount of sum... I chose no because it is either a number or nothing. "
65,2.30,Yes,Female,,2,56,english,2,no
66,,Confused,,,-1,,,-1,
67,2.00,Yes,Female,I thought it was better than most surveys and enjoyed the difference.,2,45,English,1,no
68,2.30,Yes,Female,"1. There was one I may have gotten wrong because I forgot the number of balls mentioned as I was counting them. 2. The first time it asked if I had received some of the balls when I had gotten all, I said disagree because I thought that was the answer being looked for. However, subsequently, as I looked at the name of the hit and reminded myself it was a language game, I decided to go with what I really felt and chose agree. Whether you got one ball or all, to me that means you got at least some. 3. I am curious why you specified people had to use their index fingers.
",2,49,English,3,no
69,2.30,Yes,Female,this was interesting and kind of fun like a game. I would like more HIT's like this,2,45,english,3,I accidentally hit yes twice when it should have been no
70,yes,Yes,Female,"As I said above, I think the only thing that wasn't explained was what to do if the amount of gumballs was more and it said did you get 5 (for example if there were 10) - the answer literally is you did get 5 but should have been some kind of info about what to do in those circumstances so that was frustrating.",1,48,English,3,I think the only thing that wasn't explained was what to do if the amount of gumballs was more and it said did you get 5 (for example if there were 10) - the answer literally is you did get 5 but should have been some kind of info about what to do in those circumstances. 
71,1.90,Yes,Female,I liked this fun game hit and like to perform more game tasks like this one again.,2,45,english,3,just a little slow at times other than that no problems

74,2.30 is very fair - thank you!,Yes,Female,"I was confused when the statement was ""you got some of the gumballs"" and I actually got all of them.  Technically, I did get some, but I responded it was incorrect because I got all.   Not sure if that is what you intended.  ",2,65,English,2,worked fine
75,2.30,Yes,Male,"The instructions 'Remember: J means ""agree"" and F means ""disagree""' kept bothering me as F is on the left and J on the right.  Had to keep reminding myself which key was which.  Experiment was interesting though: to what degree are you being accurate and what degree helpful to the clerk.",2,52,English,4,no

78,1.50,Yes,Male,"I need to be frank. Although I have seen gumball machines multiple times, I have never obtained something from one. I may have interpreted this HIT incorrectly in the beginning. For example: ""You got all of the gumballs"" I was thinking about the shopper saying it to the store clerk. And after all these exercises, I'm not sure if I got things correctly.",2,48,English,3,None
79,yes,Yes,Female,Did I get some of the gum balls if I got all of the gumballs?  That's the only time I wasn't sure if I answered accurately.,1,60,English,2,No

84,2.30,Yes,Male,"When it said ""you got 3 of the gumballs"" for example and a larger amount was actually removed, that was technically correct, but not accurate enough to report it as correct to the worker.",2,48,English,3,No issues that I saw.

98,2.75,Yes,Female,see comments above.,2,70,English,2,"The only issue I had is that I interpreted ""some"" as being fewer than all. So if I got ""all"" of the gumballs, and the audio said I got ""some"" of the gumballs, I disagreed."
