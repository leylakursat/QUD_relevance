English,"I wish I could have gone back to fix the one or two mistakes. I was a little confused on the why the worker would be fired (basically I was told that I lied, making it seemed like it was jammed when it wasn't) Why should he be fired for that? (If it's really not jammed, why should he be fired?~ I think they would test it and see~That's why I answered ""when it was empty"" ~ Most likely his job was to keep it full) Maybe I'm over-thinking this. (because his job couldn't be to repair it, otherwise when reported, he would just repair it ~ no big deal)",Female,62,Yes,2,3,"I know I made one or two mistakes, but couldn't go back to correct them.",41,2.30
